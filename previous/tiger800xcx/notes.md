## todo

> Our only other immediate complaint concerned the fork, which in stock trim
> bottomed under even moderate braking. Stiffer fork springs would surely solve
> this problem, and WP will be happy to sell you a set for \$120. But first we
> tried the cheap-and-easy fix: raising the oil level to reduce the volume of
> air in the fork, thus creating a more progressive “air spring” as the fork
> nears the end of its stroke. Adding 20cc per leg worked wonders, to the point
> that we’re reconsidering the need for stiffer springs. [source][0]
